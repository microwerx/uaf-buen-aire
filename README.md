# UAF Buen Aire
UAF Buen Aire is an Air Quality prediction tool. "Buen Aire" means "good air" which is something we all need.

## Development Notes

20190919: Created a test ZeroMQ data server that reports hello world based on `http://hintjens.com/blog:42`. The goal is for this server to be a simple sink for obtaining data from Purple Air sensors. Second, we want to monitor the Sense HAT for sensor data and the GPS for location information.
